Question:

in case you face issue mentioned in the link
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/49126/created-hyper-v-machine-does-not-boot

Microsoft Hyper-V UEFI
Virtual machine boot summary

    SCSI DVD (0,1) the boot loader did not load an OS
    SCSI disk (0,0) the boot loader did not load an OS
    Network adapter (00155D004E00) a boot image was not found

ANSWER:


We have experienced this on 64 bit systems too (we never use 32bit).
It appears that the boot loader will present the PXE message, and even if you click inside Hyper-V and press space to boot from the CD (ISO) it will ignore you.

However, if you
* press 'reset' in the tool bar
* as soon as the black screen appears, click in the black screen and press space

You have to be super super quick, it will then boot from the ISO image.

This issue has been there for a few years now, and I'm surprised it's not fixed.
